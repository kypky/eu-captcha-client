# DSF EU CAPTCHA Integration Demo
This is a .NET 6 Razor Pages demo application to demonstrate how to integrate (Server-Side) with the EU CAPTCHA managed API.

## What is EU CAPTCHA?
EU CAPTCHA embodies the results of ISAÂ² Action 2018.08 EU-Captcha . A CAPTCHA is a test intended to distinguish human from machine input. The objective of this action is to offer to the Member States a CAPTCHA solution that is maintained, secure, user friendly and multilingual. It will be delivered as a component that can be operated as a service. Next to this managed service, there is also an open source project available, which you can deploy yourself.  

A CAPTCHA is an essential component of information systems dealing specifically with human users, such as citizens. Having an open source secure and user-friendly CAPTCHA prevents from having to acquire or implement a specific one in several information systems. It allows Member States to offer a consistent user experience throughout public services in Europe for a step-in administrative process that are perceived as complicated by many users. The EU CAPTCHA solution solves a common problem in a consistent and cost-effective way and solves a common problem that is not related to any particular sector or EU Member State.
